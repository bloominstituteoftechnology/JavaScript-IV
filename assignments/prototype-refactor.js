/* 

Prototype Refactor

1. Copy and paste your code or the solution from yesterday

2. Your goal is to refactor all of this code to use ES6 Classes. The console.log() statements should still return what is expected of them.

/*
  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be 
  implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance heirarchy.

  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.  

  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  
  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.
  
  Each constructor function has unique properites and methods that are defined in their block comments below:

  === GameObject ===
  * createdAt
  * dimensions
  * destroy() // prototype method -> returns the string: 'Object was removed from the game.'
