// // CODE here for your Lambda Classes
// #### Person

// * First we need a Person class. This will be our `base-class`
// * Person receives `name` `age` `location` `gender` all as props
// * Person receives `speak` as a method.
// * This method logs out a phrase `Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock` where `name` and `location` are the object's own props
class Person {
    constructor (personAttributes){
        this.name = personAttributes.name;
        this.age = personAttributes.age;
        this.location = personAttributes.location;
        this.gender = personAttributes.gender;
    }
    introduction(){
        console.log(`Hello my name is ${name}, I am from ${location}`);
    }
}


// #### Instructor

// * Now that we have a Person as our base class, we'll build our Instructor class.
// * Instructor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// * Instructor has the following unique props:
//   * `specialty` what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
//   * `favLanguage` i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
//   * `catchPhrase` i.e. `Don't forget the homies`
// * Instructor has the following methods:
//   * `demo` receives a `subject` string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
//   * `grade` receives a `student` object and a `subject` string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'

// #### Student

// * Now we need some students!
// * Student uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// * Student has the following unique props:
//   * `previousBackground` i.e. what the Student used to do before Lambda School
//   * `className` i.e. CS132
//   * `favSubjects`. i.e. an array of the student's favorite subjects ['Html', 'CSS', 'JavaScript']
// * Student has the following methods:
//   * `listsSubjects` a method that logs out all of the student's favoriteSubjects one by one.
//   * `PRAssignment` a method that receives a subject as an argument and logs out that the `student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}`
//   * `sprintChallenge` similar to PRAssignment but logs out `student.name has begun sprint challenge on {subject}`

// #### Project Mananger

// * Now that we have instructors and students, we'd be nowhere without our PM's
// * ProjectManagers are extensions of Instructors
// * ProjectManagers have the following uniqe props:
//   * `gradClassName`: i.e. CS1
//   * `favInstructor`: i.e. Sean
// * ProjectManangers have the following Methods:
//   * `standUp` a method that takes in a slack channel and logs `{name} announces to {channel}, @channel standy times!​​​​​
//   * `debugsCode` a method that takes in a student object and a subject and logs out `{name} debugs {student.name}'s code on {subject}`

// #### Stretch Problem

// * Extend the functionality of the Student by adding a prop called grade and setting it equal to a number between 1-100.
// * Now that our students have a grade build out a method on the Instructor (this will be used by _BOTH_ instructors and PM's) that will randomly add or subtract points to a student's grade. _Math.random_ will help.
// * Add a graduate method to a student.
//   * This method, when called, will check the grade of the student and see if they're ready to graduate from Lambda School
//   * If the student's grade is above a 70% let them graduate! Otherswise go back to grading their assignments to increase their score.
