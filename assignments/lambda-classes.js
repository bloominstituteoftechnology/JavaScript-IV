// CODE here for your Lambda Classes


// * First we need a Person class. This will be our `base-class`
// * Person receives `name` `age` `location` `gender` all as props
// * Person receives `speak` as a method.
// * This method logs out a phrase `Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock` where `name` and `location` are the object's own props

class Person {
    constructor (props) {
        this.name = props.name;
        this.age = props.age;
        this.location = props.location;
        this.gender = props.gender;
    }

    speak () {
        console.log(`Hello my name is ${this.name}, I am from ${this.location}`);
    }
}
